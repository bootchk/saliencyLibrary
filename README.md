SALIENCY DETECTION
==================

Work in progress.  Derived from https://github.com/kkduncan/SaliencyDetection.git

Goals/changes:
- remove cruft
- remove git history
- more use of open CV
- explore acceleration openCV v3 transparent api to openCL?
- autotools to make a library
- gimp plugin


The .project is an Eclipse IDE project.  Minimal GUI dev machine requires JRE (Java runtime) and Eclipse C/C++ IDE.



Depends on openCV (package opencv-dev, which includes headers and libraries.)
